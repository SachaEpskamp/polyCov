Description: 	This is a very small package with only one function, polyCov(), 
		designed to simplify the implementation of ordinal multigroup 
		factor analysis in R. This function can be used to estimate a 
		polychoric (or tetrachoric) correlation matrix assuming 
		standardized latent items. If thresholds are given, it estimates 
		polychoric covariances, means and variances.
